The US-003 story implementation is complete. The story was already fully implemented and committed by a previous iteration (`350ec5f`). My work this iteration was verification:

## Summary

**US-003: UI real-time dashboard widget** - Already Complete

### Verification Results:

1. **API Endpoints Working:**
   - `GET /api/streams/:id/status` - Returns phase, story_id, story_title, iteration, elapsed_seconds, updated_at
   - `GET /api/streams/:id/events` - Returns parsed events array with timestamp, level, message, details

2. **File Watcher Configured:**
   - Emits `status_updated` when `.status.json` changes
   - Emits `events_updated` when `.events.log` changes
   - Supports both PRD folder and worktree paths

3. **Widget Component:**
   - Shows phase badge (planning/executing/committing/verifying)
   - Shows story ID and title
   - Shows elapsed time
   - Shows iteration number
   - Shows last 5 recent events with color-coded icons

4. **Widget Visibility:**
   - Appears when status file exists (build running)
   - Hides with `rams-hidden` class when no build active

5. **Browser Verification:**
   - Dashboard loads correctly
   - Widget updates via SSE/HTMX
   - All visual elements render properly

### Commit:
- `350ec5f` - feat(ui): implement real-time dashboard widget for build status (US-003)

No new commit needed - implementation already committed by previous iteration. Story is complete but PRD has 14 remaining unchecked stories.
