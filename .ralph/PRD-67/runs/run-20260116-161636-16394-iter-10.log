## Summary

I have verified and completed US-012: Multi-channel notifications. The implementation was already done in prior iterations with the following key components:

**Implementation verified:**
1. **Notification channels**: CLI (always enabled), Slack, Discord, Email, and Webhooks - all implemented in `.agents/ralph/lib/notify.sh` and `lib/notify/*.js`
2. **Events**: build_complete, build_failed, stalled, needs_human - integrated in loop.sh and watchdog.sh
3. **Configuration file**: `.agents/ralph/notify.conf` - shell-sourceable config with all channel settings
4. **Graceful failure**: All notification functions return success even on errors, run in background to prevent blocking
5. **Test command**: `ralph notify test` - tests all configured channels
6. **Email notification**: Full implementation with mail/sendmail support

**Verification commands run:**
- `ralph notify status` - Shows all 5 channels with configuration status
- `ralph notify test` - Sends test notifications to all configured channels
- Bash sourcing tests for notify.sh functions

**Commits for US-012:**
- `2ce57b6` - Initial implementation
- `32e91e0` - Complete multi-channel notifications
- `6c5014f` - Progress entry (iteration 12)
- `cad26f5` - Progress entry for this iteration (10)

There are still 5 remaining stories in Phase 5 (TypeScript Migration): US-013 through US-017.
