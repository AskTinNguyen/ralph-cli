Good. US-013 implementation is complete with:

- **Commit:** `fa7a5b0 feat(failure-detection): extract failure detection to TypeScript (US-013)`
- **Test results:** 95 tests passed
- **Coverage:** 99.48% statements, 87.3% branches (exceeds >80% requirement)
- **Patterns:** 68 regex patterns (exceeds 40+ requirement)
- **CLI:** `node lib/failure-detection/cli.js "$log_file"` working with all options
- **Bash integration:** `detect_failure_ts()` and `classify_failure_ts()` functions in loop.sh

The PRD still has incomplete stories (US-014 through US-017), so the build should continue rather than signal COMPLETE.

**Summary:** US-013 (Extract failure detection to TypeScript) has been successfully implemented and verified. All acceptance criteria are met:
1. ✅ Module at `lib/failure-detection/index.js` 
2. ✅ 68 regex patterns (exceeds 40+ requirement)
3. ✅ 95 unit tests with full pattern coverage
4. ✅ Bash integration via CLI
5. ✅ 99.48% test coverage (exceeds 80% requirement)
