## Summary

**US-008: Budget warnings and enforcement** was already implemented in a previous iteration (commit `7a6512b`). This iteration verified all 6 acceptance criteria are met:

1. ✅ **Budget config file**: `.ralph/PRD-N/.budget.json` created by `ralph budget set`
2. ✅ **Warning at 75%** (yellow): `display_budget_warning()` with event logging
3. ✅ **Warning at 90%** (orange): `display_budget_warning()` with event logging  
4. ✅ **Error at 100%** (red, build pauses): `check_and_enforce_budget()` + `prompt_budget_continue()`
5. ✅ **Warnings in CLI and UI**: CLI via budget.sh, UI via `/api/partials/budget-display`
6. ✅ **Budget command**: `ralph budget set <amount>` - lib/commands/budget.js

**Verification Results:**
- Budget percentage calculation: 8/8 tests passed
- Threshold detection: 4/4 tests passed
- Budget limit reading: PASS
- Enforcement check: PASS
- Budget module direct test: PASS

**Files changed:**
- `.ralph/PRD-67/progress.md` (added verification log)

**Commit:** `4d792e6 docs(PRD-67): add verification log for US-008 budget warnings (iteration 6)`

**Post-commit status:** clean (remaining files are unrelated S2-Game content)

There are still 9 unchecked stories remaining in the PRD (US-009 through US-017), so no completion signal is output.
