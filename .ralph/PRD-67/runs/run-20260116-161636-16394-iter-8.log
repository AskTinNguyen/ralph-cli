There are still 7 unchecked stories remaining in the PRD (US-011 through US-017). US-010 is complete, but the PRD is not fully complete. Let me end normally as instructed.

**Summary:** US-010: Watchdog process for auto-recovery has been successfully implemented and committed.

**What was implemented:**
- Created `.agents/ralph/lib/watchdog.sh` (450+ lines) with full watchdog functionality:
  - State management (`.watchdog.state` JSON file)
  - Heartbeat monitoring with configurable check interval (default 60s)
  - Consecutive stall tracking with restart after 3 stalls
  - Maximum 3 restarts before escalating to NEEDS_HUMAN status
  - Comprehensive logging to `watchdog.log`
  - Auto-termination when lock file disappears

- Integrated watchdog into `stream.sh`:
  - Spawns as separate process when stream build starts
  - Stopped in exit trap when build completes
  - CLI displays watchdog status

**Verification:**
- bash -n syntax checks: PASS
- 10/10 unit tests passed

**Commit:** `66f0a07 feat(watchdog): implement watchdog process for auto-recovery (US-010)`
