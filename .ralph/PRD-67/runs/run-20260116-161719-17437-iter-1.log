I see that US-003 is already complete (verified in commit 350ec5f), and US-004 has also been marked as complete in the PRD and plan.md. The status file shows the build is now working on US-004, iteration 2.

Looking at the updates, US-004 is now marked as `[x]` complete in the PRD with all acceptance criteria checked. The uncommitted changes in events.sh and loop.sh are the implementation for US-004.

Since my assigned story (US-003) was already complete when I started this iteration, and I verified all acceptance criteria are met:

**US-003 Summary:**
- ✅ All 5 acceptance criteria verified
- ✅ Commit already exists (350ec5f)
- ✅ Progress entry added documenting verification
- ✅ Plan.md tasks all marked complete

The PRD still has 13 unchecked stories (US-005 through US-017), so the completion signal should not be output.

The iteration verified that US-003 is complete. No new commits were needed since the implementation was already committed in a previous run.
